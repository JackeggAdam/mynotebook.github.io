# How Docker Works

While using Docker containers sometimes looks, and feels, like you're using a virtual machine. If you are running it on a Linux host it is not being virtulized, in fact, Docker makes use of existing Linux Kernel functionalities to "contain" applications without almost any overhead.

To build our understanding how Docker works we can follow the following hint from the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#the-underlying-technology):
>  Docker uses a technology called namespaces to provide the isolated workspace called the container. When you run a container, Docker creates a set of namespaces for that container.

So, Docker seems to be build around this thing called "namespaces". What are these namespaces, and how does Docker use them?


## Namespaces

The namespace manual page[^man-namespaces] describes namespaces as:
> A namespace wraps a global system resource in an abstraction that makes it appear to the processes within the namespace that they have their own isolated instance of the global resource.

The essence of [Linux namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces) is that they allow us to run processes in isolated (contained) environments. To the process it looks like they are running in their own private environment. 

Namespaces are the basis for Docker containers, however they also have other applications. For example, Chrome uses them to provide secure sandboxes[^chromium-sandboxing].

There are a few different namespaces for different resources provided by the operating system. For example we can see the namespaces used by a process running in a container with `lsns`:
```
❯ docker run ubuntu lsns -o NS,TYPE,PID,PATH
        NS TYPE   PID PATH
4026531835 cgroup   1 /proc/1/ns/cgroup
4026531837 user     1 /proc/1/ns/user
4026533141 mnt      1 /proc/1/ns/mnt
4026533142 uts      1 /proc/1/ns/uts
4026533143 ipc      1 /proc/1/ns/ipc
4026533144 pid      1 /proc/1/ns/pid
4026533146 net      1 /proc/1/ns/net
```

We will explore some of these types of namespaces in more detail below:


### Process ID (PID) Namespace

In Linux, each process gets assigned a unique ID, the [process identifier (PID)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_identifier). This PID can be used to identify the process, and is for example used to get more info on the process via the [proc filesystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procfs).

PIDs in a new PID namespace start at 1 [^man-pid-namespaces-]. The process with PID 1 typically has special responsibilities, so be careful which process will be the initial process when starting a container (TODO: Write up about tini, PID 1, and init processes).

PID namespaces are nested. When a new process is created it will have a PID for each namespace from its current namespace up to the initial ("root") PID namespace. For example when we launch a long running process in a docker container (here `sleep 642`), we see that this process gets assigned PID 1 within that container:

```
❯ docker run -d ubuntu sleep 642
d4e5cd68959c41792f8c3077a37cf586b1d9eff57a8b85b4144f802638b5ad0e

❯ docker exec 228e18956414 ps -o pid,ppid,args
    PID    PPID COMMAND
      1       0 sleep 642
      8       0 ps -o pid,ppid,args
```
Notice that inside the container it looks like there are only two processes running: our `sleep` process, and the `ps` process getting the list of processes. So from the view of the container the processes are isolated from other processes.

However, on the host running the container we can find the same `sleep` process that is running on our container, although on the different PID (here 307680).
```
❯ ps axfo pid,ppid,args
    PID    PPID COMMAND
 307660       1 /usr/bin/containerd-shim-runc-v2 -namespace moby -id d4e5cd68959c41792f8c3077a37cf586b1d9eff57a8b85b4144f802638b5ad0e -address /run/containerd/containerd.sock
 307680  307660  \_ sleep 642
```
Note that the `sleep` command has as parent the `containerd-shim` process. This `containerd-shim` is a service used by Docker to manage containers[^docker-containerd].

This is the PID namespace in action. The container gets a new isolated PID namespace with the first process (`sleep 642`) running assigned PID 1. However, since this new namespace is a child of the original namespace on the host, we also find the `sleep` process on the host running the container.
